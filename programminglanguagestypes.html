         <h3>Java</h3>
		 
		 Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995. It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java. It is used for: Mobile applications (specially Android apps), Desktop applications, Web applications, Web servers and application servers, Games, Database connection, And much, much more! Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.) It is one of the most popular programming language in the world, It is easy to learn and simple to use, It is open-source and free, It is secure, fast and powerful, It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers). Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa.
		 
		 <h3>Javascript</h3>
	     
		 JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development and adding interactivity on websites. It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.
	 
	     <h3>Python </h3>
		 
		 Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.Python is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It is used in web development, data science, creating software prototypes, and so on. Fortunately for beginners, Python has simple easy-to-use syntax. This makes Python an excellent language to learn to program for beginners. It is used for: web development (server-side), software development, mathematics, system scripting.
         Python can be used on a server to create web applications, Python can be used alongside software to create workflows, Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files, Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics, Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
		 
		 
		 <h3>C</h3>
		 
		 C programming is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. C is the most widely used computer language. It keeps fluctuating at number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language, which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern software programmers. C programming language is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C Programming: Easy to learn, Structured language, It produces efficient programs, It can handle low-level activities, It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms.
		 
		 <h3>C#</h3>
		 
		 C# is pronounced "C-Sharp". It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework. C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java. The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 8, was released in September 2019. C# is used for: Mobile applications, Desktop applications, Web applications, Web services, Web sites, Games, VR, Database applications And much, much more!. It is one of the most popular programming language in the world, It is easy to learn and simple to use, It has a huge community support, C# is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. As C# is close to C, C++ and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C# or vice versa.

		 <h3>C++</h3>
		 
		 C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications. C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language. C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory. The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17. C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages. C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems. C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms. C++ is fun and easy to learn!. As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.
