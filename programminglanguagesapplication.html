	         Top Programming Languages and Their Real World Applications
             Programming languages are used to power the technology we use every day. 
             
			 <p>Python: Behind your favorite website, Python is at work. Coders use this web-based basic scripting language to program the backend of websites like YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest and Quora.</p>

             <p>C: This language is one of the first high-level languages developed and is fast, structured, portable and has a rich library. All of these features allow C to have applications across every domain in the world of programming. C is used in all the operating systems in your computer and your cellphone and even in programming robots.</p>
             
			 <p>Java: Java places third on the list and for good reason — it can run on many devices. If you have an Android phone, all of your apps are running Java. Big data technologies are using Java as their language of choice because of its excellent capabilities of compiling and organizing data.</p>
             
			 <p>C++: This programming language is an object-oriented programming language that incorporates all the features of C. C++ is used for operating systems, games, embedded software, autonomous cars and medical technology, as well as many other applications. Companies like Facebook and Google use C++.</p>
              
			 <p>Common Uses of JavaScript: JavaScript is mainly used in the following: Websites, Web Applications As browsers and personal computers have continued to improve, JavaScript gained the ability to create robust web applications. Consider applications like Google Maps. If you want to explore a map in Google Maps, all you have to do is click and drag with the mouse. You will see the part of the map that is less detailed and then fills itself in. That’s the work of JavaScript behind the scene.</p>
